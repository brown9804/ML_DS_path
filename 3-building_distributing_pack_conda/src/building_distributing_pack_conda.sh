# #--  --  --  -- Building and Distributing Packages with Conda
# # Used for Data Scientist Training Path 
# #FYI it's a compilation of how to work
# #with different commands.

# ### --------------------------------------------------------
# # # ------>>>> What is an Anaconda Project? 
# In the Conda Essentials 
# course you learned how use 
# the Conda package manager to 
# create and share reproducible 
# environments for data science 
# development. 

# In this chapter you'll create 
# an Anaconda Project, which is 
# a data science asset that 
# specifies package installs, 
# file downloads, and 
# executable commands. Anaconda 
# projects can be used to run 
# Jupyter notebooks, Bokeh 
# server apps, REST APIs, and 
# command line tools on 
# Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux 
# platforms making deployment 
# easy. 

# Anaconda projects are shared 
# amongst data scientists as 
# compressed directories 
# containing the Conda 
# environment specification, 
# URLs for downloadable files, 
# and source code for commands. 
# Collaboration can be achieved 
# through text file revision 
# control tools, like git. 

# In the following exercises 
# you'll learn how to create, 
# run, and share Anaconda 
# Projects. 

# Which of the following CANNOT 
# be achieved with an Anaconda 
# Project?
